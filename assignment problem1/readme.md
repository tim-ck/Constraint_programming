I have designed a basic problem statement to tested out CP solving NP problem. Here is the problem statement for our assignment problem:

## Problem : Exam Center Assignment
## Problem Statement:
Assign candidates to exam centers for a multi-day exam. We assume each district only have one center. There are serve preferences and constraints for center allowcation:

1. **Capacity Constraints**:   
    For each exam day, there are maximum capacity for each center and it could be different in different day.
2. **District Perference**:  
   Each candidate has a preferred exam district. Ideally, a candidate should be assigned to their preferred center on every day.
3. **Consistency Across Day**:
   To reduce candidate inconvenience, a candidate should ideally be assigned to the same center on every exam day.
